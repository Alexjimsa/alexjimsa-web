## Project Description
This is a landing page project inspired by **Ebro**, the Spanish automobile brand that has recently reemerged in the market. The project was conceived as a rapid development exercise, completed in a single day with the specific goal of practicing **fast execution** and overcoming the perfectionism tendency that often slows down the creative process.

## Context and Purpose
The philosophy behind this project is clear: prioritize action over perfection. Instead of spending days refining every detail, the approach was to create something functional and visually appealing within a very limited timeframe. This type of exercise is valuable for developers looking to improve their ability to deliver tangible results under time pressure, a crucial skill in real professional environments.

## Technical Structure
The project uses an intentionally minimalist tech stack:
- **Semantic HTML**: Clear structure with elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<main>`
- **Pure CSS**: No frameworks or preprocessors, just vanilla CSS to maintain simplicity
- **Responsive design**: Although basic, it includes considerations for different screen sizes through flexbox and relative units

## Notable Aspects
What's interesting about this project isn't so much its technical complexity, but rather its methodological approach. It represents a conscious exercise in:
- **Time management**: Completing a visual project in 24 hours
- **Quick decision-making**: Choosing solutions that work over "perfect" solutions
- **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**: Creating something presentable and functional without superfluous features
- **Practical learning**: Using a real Spanish brand as inspiration to make the exercise more authentic

These types of projects are excellent for building portfolios, practicing fundamental skills, and developing the confidence necessary to launch projects without getting trapped in infinite refinement cycles.
